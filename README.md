## ðŸ“– About 

(Untitled 3D Project) is a tool designed to make 3D animation more accessible than ever. Planned features include:
- A non-destructive, layer-based animation workflow
- A cutting-edge 3D renderer with wholly dynamic lighting
- An extensible asset system that can support arbitrary file formats, including other games
Note that this project is still in early development, and it's goals are continually in flux.

## ðŸš€ Status

This project has been in development for more than a year across various forms, but is still *far* from feature-complete. This repo exists just for the sake of transparency, and is not expected to be built or contributed to.
